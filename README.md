# PhantomBot
The PhantomBot is a Discord bot. It can watch channels in which users count and delete wrong messages. There are four different types of counting channels:
* Regular counting channels (channels in which users count regularly, like 1, 2, 3, 4, ...)
* Prime counting channels (channels in which users count prime numbers, like 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, ...)
* Power counting channels (channels in which users count powers of a number, like 2, 4, 8, 16, ...)
* Pi counting channels (channels in which users count digits of Pi, like 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, ...)

The bot deletes messages that are wrong as well as users that reply to themselves.

Other features involve a level system where users gain points when they count in counting channels and a command to make the bot count in that channel. For a detailed view on features, see the wiki.

This bot is in Beta. Once the Beta is over, there will be an invite link for the bot here.
